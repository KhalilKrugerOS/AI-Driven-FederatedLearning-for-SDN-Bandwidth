# Network_Intrusion_Detection
Detecting network intrusions involves leveraging various machine learning algorithms to monitor a network or system for malicious activities and protect it against unauthorized access, including potential insider threats. The goal of the intrusion detection task is to develop a predictive model (classifier) that can accurately differentiate between "bad connections" (intrusions or attacks) and "good connections" (normal, legitimate traffic).
